# Data_Exploration_and_Classification

<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project consists of my proficiency in data analysis and machine learning using Python. The objective was to thoroughly explore dataset attributes through various visual and statistical measures and to develop a classification model to evaluate performance. I selected Maternal Health Risk as my dataset. The project encomppased tasks such as: introducing the problem, aims, and assumptions; exploring the dataset with feature identification, summary statistics, cleaniness assessment, and visualisations; developing, optimising, and analysing a Decision Tree Classifier using metrics such as confusion matrices and feature importance; and discussing and comparing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
